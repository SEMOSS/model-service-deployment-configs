# Model Service Deployment Configurations

This repository contains the deployment YAML files for various models and the scripts required to upload them to the bucket that the Kubernetes Model Scaler uses to deploy the models.

NOTE: This requires a file named `creds.json` in the root with the credentials for the GCP service account.
